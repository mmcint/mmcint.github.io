Hi! My name is Mike McIntire, and I appreciate you taking the time to check out my personal website. I’m a geoscientist by education who transitioned into data science. This website highlights my journey, skills, and accomplishments in the field.

My career began as a geophysicist, where I built three-dimensional models of the Earth using advanced quantitative methods. During this time, I developed a growing interest in Python programming and machine learning. What started as a curiosity turned into a passion, as I began acquiring coding skills and exploring the potential of machine learning to solve complex problems.

The pandemic presented a unique opportunity for self-growth. After exhausting the Netflix catalog, I decided to dive deeper into data science and enrolled in a comprehensive data science bootcamp. This experience supercharged my learning, and the projects you’ll find here represent work I completed as part of the bootcamp. They serve as an early representation of my data science skills, so no judgment please!

Since transitioning into data science, I’ve had the privilege of working with several fascinating companies, applying my skills to tackle diverse challenges. This portfolio includes not only projects from my bootcamp but also select work from my professional experiences, demonstrating my capabilities in real-world scenarios.
