Work experience
======
**Security Benefit - Lead Data Scientist (September 2024 - Present)**
* Lead team of data scientists building products that affect all parts of the organization.
* Utilized unsupervised machine learning techniques to build financial advisor profiles for improved marketing campaigns.
* Developed machine learning model using Python and XGBoost to predict financial advisor profiles for prospective advisors.

**ThinkOnward - Data Scientist (May 2023 - September 2024)**
* Collaborate with customers to understand business problems and develop machine learning challenges that accomplish the needs of their team. Communicate technical results     from data science challenges using Plotly Dash and Streamlit.
* Oversee the maintenance and general improvement of open source geoscience packages using GitHub and git workflow.
* Improve user experience by developing interactive documentation on GitHub for open source Python package that optimizes drilling rig schedules.
* Lead team of scientists to develop a geophysics specific foundational model using Vision Transformers and Masked Auto-encoders methodology. Utilize Pytorch, Numpy, and       HuggingFace Transformers to build proprietary masking method that increases model performance 3 times over existing models. 
* Enhance the volume of 3D synthetic seismic data generation by 50% by parallelizing Python code and leveraging AWS Batch. 
* Increase productivity of scientists in Shell by 25% by authoring a Python script that clusters similar thin section images and filters out of focus images.

**Commerce Bank - Data Scientist (October 2022 - May 2023)**
* Managed relationships with the fraud teams and communicated concise updates to primary stakeholders.
* Leveraged PowerBI to build a model performance dashboard that helped the consumer fraud team identify 2 million dollars in fraudulent transactions. Reduced the number of     false positives and false negatives by optimizing the model’s F1 score.
* Collaborated with consumer credit team and leveraged agile methodology to build a credit card acquisition response model with an increased response rate of 30%. 
* Extracted consumer credit data from SQL databases and transformed data into a weekly report for keep stakeholders using SAS.
    
**Farmers Insurance - Data Scientist (November 2021 - October 2022)**
* Improved profitability of business insurance book by identifying policies with high risk of wildfire using ArcGIS and communicating results via PowerBI.
* Leveraged AWS Sagemaker environment to build and test a policy pricing model using Python and XGBoost. Collaborate with team on GitHub to share Python code.
* Built an ETL pipeline using Alteryx that extracted policy data from Snowflake SQL database into PowerBI. Leverage DAX and PowerQuery to clean and transform data for          visualization.
* Generated policy pricing maps by using geospatial analytics tools (GeoPandas and GDAL) and 3rd party customer data.

**Occidental/Anadarko Petroleum Corporation - Senior Geophysicist (May 2014 - November 2021)**
* Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of engineers and geoscientists to evaluate prospects of interest in the Gulf of Mexico and regularly communicating progress to     executives.
* Developed 3D geologic model for hydrocarbon producing asset in the western Gulf of Mexico using 3D seismic surveys, Multibeam sonar, and well log data. Work allowed          company to extend production of the asset and avoid $120 million dollars in abandonment costs. 
* Led a team of subject matter experts to identify and develop updated geophysical technical workflows and best practices  following Occidental Petroleum’s 2019 acquisition    of Anadarko Petroleum. 
* Authored yearly technical reports to federal agencies (SEC, BOEM, BSEE) that justified hydrocarbon reserves and provided  insight into geoscience workflows. 
* Orchestrated a project to invest four million dollars for federal leases in the central Gulf of Mexico by investigating multiple sensor data sources and compiling a          concise story for executives. Leveraged Monte Carlo simulation to examine project risk and economics.
* Executed a successful development well and delivered 25% rate or return on initial investment by qualifying oil reserves using seismic and well data analysis.
